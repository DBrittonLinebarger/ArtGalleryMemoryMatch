# Milestone 2  

### Current State of Implementation   

The project now includes: all 4 Room entity classes, DAO interfaces, an abstract database class,
a working Dashboard Fragment, and a Theme View Model. The app builds, runs and it looks like the 
database is being created (preloaded with theme titles).  The reachable fragment is the Dashboard
Fragment and it has a spinner that displays test themes from the database. I have updated the ERD
and wireframes.


### Walk-through of Viewing Content in Database     

The user will click on the Dashboard icon and this will take them to the Dashboard Fragment.  Here
they will be able to click on a spinner with a dropdown list of previously stored/used themes for
games.  At this point in the implementation, the content in the theme database was preloaded for
this deliverable.  The user will also be provided(eventually) with the option to search for new
themes in this fragment.
